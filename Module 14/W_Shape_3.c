/*
To print a diamond shape with 2N rows (like in your example, N = 4), you need to build two parts:

Top half: A pyramid of stars from 1 up to 2N - 1 stars (increasing).

Bottom half: An inverted pyramid from 2N - 1 stars down to 1 (decreasing).

Here's a breakdown for N = 4:

cpp
Copy
Edit
   *        // row 1: 3 spaces, 1 star
  ***       // row 2: 2 spaces, 3 stars
 *****      // row 3: 1 space , 5 stars
*******     // row 4: 0 spaces, 7 stars
*******     // row 5: 0 spaces, 7 stars
 *****      // row 6: 1 space , 5 stars
  ***       // row 7: 2 spaces, 3 stars
   *        // row 8: 3 spaces, 1 star
✅ C Code to Solve the Problem:
c
Copy
Edit
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int N;
    scanf("%d", &N);

    // Top half of the diamond
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int spaces = N - i - 1;
        int stars = 2 * i + 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < spaces; j++) {
            printf(" ");
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < stars; j++) {
            printf("*");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // Bottom half of the diamond
    for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        int spaces = N - i - 1;
        int stars = 2 * i + 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < spaces; j++) {
            printf(" ");
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < stars; j++) {
            printf("*");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
🔍 Explanation:
spaces = N - i - 1: Controls indentation.

stars = 2 * i + 1: Ensures odd number of stars to form the diamond shape.

The first loop builds rows from 1 star up to the middle.

The second loop mirrors it downward.

Sure! Let's walk through the code line by line with a detailed explanation:

c
Copy
Edit
#include <stdio.h>
🔹 This line includes the Standard Input Output library so we can use functions like printf and scanf.

c
Copy
Edit
int main() {
🔹 This is the main function where the program starts executing.

c
Copy
Edit
    int N;
🔹 Declares an integer variable N to store the input value. This represents half the height of the diamond (since total rows = 2 × N).

c
Copy
Edit
    scanf("%d", &N);
🔹 Reads the input number from the user and stores it in the variable N.

Top Half of the Diamond (including the middle row):
c
Copy
Edit
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
🔹 Starts a loop from 0 to N-1.

i represents the current row number in the top half.

This will print the first N rows of the diamond.

c
Copy
Edit
        int spaces = N - i - 1;
🔹 Calculates how many spaces to print before the stars.

As you go down, the number of spaces decreases.

Example for N = 4: on row i = 0, spaces = 3; on i = 1, spaces = 2, etc.

c
Copy
Edit
        int stars = 2 * i + 1;
🔹 Calculates how many stars to print on that row.

The stars form an odd sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7...

This gives the diamond its wide middle.

c
Copy
Edit
        for (int j = 0; j < spaces; j++) {
            printf(" ");
        }
🔹 Prints the required number of spaces before the stars for the current row.

c
Copy
Edit
        for (int j = 0; j < stars; j++) {
            printf("*");
        }
🔹 Prints the stars for the current row.

c
Copy
Edit
        printf("\n");
🔹 Moves to the next line after printing one full row of spaces and stars.

Bottom Half of the Diamond:
c
Copy
Edit
    for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
🔹 Starts a loop in reverse from N-1 to 0.

This prints the bottom half of the diamond, mirroring the top half.

c
Copy
Edit
        int spaces = N - i - 1;
        int stars = 2 * i + 1;
🔹 Same logic as above:

spaces increases as we go down the bottom half.

stars decreases (7, 5, 3, 1).

c
Copy
Edit
        for (int j = 0; j < spaces; j++) {
            printf(" ");
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < stars; j++) {
            printf("*");
        }
        printf("\n");
🔹 These loops print spaces and stars, followed by a newline, for each row in the bottom half.

c
Copy
Edit
    return 0;
}
🔹 Ends the main function and returns 0, which means the program ran successfully.

Summary of What Happens:
For input N = 4, the output is:

markdown
Copy
Edit
   *    
  ***   
 *****  
******* 
*******

  ***   
   *    
Each row is made up of spaces followed by an odd number of stars. The shape expands to the middle and then contracts symmetrically.
